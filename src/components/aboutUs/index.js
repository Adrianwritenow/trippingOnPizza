          <h1>WHO WE ARE & WHY WE DO IT</h1>
            <p> We are a conscious couple with a serious passion for pizza. Chef Mike B, an NJ native,
              and self proclaimed “pizza lifer” has worked professionally in multiple pizzerias and
              restaurants, culminating in his own brick and mortar location Pioneers Pizza in
              Southwest FL. His culinary creativity tied with a passion for organic &amp; locally sourced
              ingredients has made Pioneers Pizza the #1 restaurant in the county. Teamed with Bee
              Sunshine a loyal Clevelander who devoted her early years to raising plastic waste
              awareness and now the fight against GMO products are an exciting pizza duo, and
              together they run this pizza juggernaut.</p>
              <p>In 2018 during a trip to Chef Mike B’s homeland Avellino, Italy he decided to expand “the
              craft” by apprenticing renowned Roman pizzaiolo Chef Gabriele Bonci during that time
              he developed a new style of pie and so the Roman pizza was born, with a desire to bring
              this new found experience to the masses they are hitting the streets with their latest
              project “Trippin’ on Pizza a new style pizza food truck that’s exploding with taste and
              style.</p>
              <p>We strongly believe that pizza should be honest, creative, and taste good. Pizza has the
              power to bring friends, families and communities together. We are extremely grateful to
              the SW Florida community and for their support in our quest to bring this product on
              the road. We are truly proud to share this experience with everyone and hope all of you
              enjoy it as much as we do!
