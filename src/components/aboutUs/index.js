        <h1>WHO WE ARE & WHY WE DO IT</h1>
        <p> We are a conscious couple with a serious passion for pizza. Chef Mike B, an NJ native,<br />
and self proclaimed “pizza lifer” has worked professionally in multiple pizzerias and<br />
restaurants, culminating in his own brick and mortar location Pioneers Pizza in<br />
Southwest FL. His culinary creativity tied with a passion for organic &amp; locally sourced<br />
ingredients has made Pioneers Pizza the #1 restaurant in the county. Teamed with Bee<br />
Sunshine a loyal Clevelander who devoted her early years to raising plastic waste<br />
awareness and now the fight against GMO products are an exciting pizza duo, and<br />
together they run this pizza juggernaut.<br />
In 2018 during a trip to Chef Mike B’s homeland Avellino, Italy he decided to expand “the<br />
craft” by apprenticing renowned Roman pizzaiolo Chef Gabriele Bonci during that time<br />
he developed a new style of pie and so the Roman pizza was born, with a desire to bring<br />
this new found experience to the masses they are hitting the streets with their latest<br />
project “Trippin’ on Pizza a new style pizza food truck that’s exploding with taste and<br />
style.<br />
We strongly believe that pizza should be honest, creative, and taste good. Pizza has the<br />
power to bring friends, families and communities together. We are extremely grateful to<br />
the SW Florida community and for their support in our quest to bring this product on<br />
the road. We are truly proud to share this experience with everyone and hope all of you<br />
enjoy it as much as we do!</p>
